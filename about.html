    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p>I'm Marius, a 35 year old man living in southwest Norway. At the time of writing I am seeking employment.
    I have IT education in programming and web development, and I'm qualified as an electronics technician.
    <br><br>While I'm not very outroverted, I get along with people very well.
    I'm very patient in all situations, whether it's social, professional or educational.
    I tend to have a pragmatic and rational view on most things. I'm very fond of symmetry and "clean" simplicity.
    <br><br>When working I put full effort into each task, making sure to finish each before moving on to the next one.
    I dislike leaving something unfinished and always strive to complete stuff at the next opportunity.
    Routine is very comfortable but I have no problem with an unpredictable or changing schedule. Varied work is healthy after all.
    <br><br>Short-term I'm just looking to get working again. In the long run I'm hoping for something I truly enjoy doing in addition to being good at.</p>
