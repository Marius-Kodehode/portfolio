    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p>
    I'm Marius, a 35 year old man in southwest Norway. At the time of writing I am seeking employment.
    I have IT education in programming and web development, and I'm qualified as an electronics technician.
    <br><br>While I'm not very outroverted, I get along with people very well.
    I'm very patient in all situations, whether it's social, professional or educational.
    I tend to have a pragmatic and rational view on most things. I'm very fond of symmetry and "clean" simplicity.
