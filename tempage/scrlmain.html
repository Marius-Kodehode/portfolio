        stood against them, turning Sarkoris into a demon-infested land now known as the Worldwound.</p>
        <p>Join the Crusade against the demonic invasion and rise as a new hero wielding unimaginable
        powers in this classic CRPG. The fate of this world lies in your hands.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 15px; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
        Encased is a tactical sci-fi RPG set in a dystopian environment allowing you to fight enemies,
        explore the hostile wasteland, level up your character and join one of the factions - made up
        of survivors - in the shattered world and cut off from the rest of society.</p>
        <p>Start the game in one of the five divisions of the CRONUS Corporation - Wings, each with its
        own features, mechanics, and game options. Go on a one way trip under the Dome from which you
        cannot return. Avoid radiation and anomalies, fight mutated animals and search for unique
        artifacts.</p>
        <p>Encased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join
        and how honourable a person you are. What equipment do you take? How will you fight? Do you
        craft better weapons or armour?</p>
        <p>And it doesn't stop there. You will hold lives in the balance and will have to choose who
        survives and who perishes.</p>
        <p>Every decision you make will impact the story and your gaming experience. Well, no one said
        surviving Armageddon was going to be easy...</p>
